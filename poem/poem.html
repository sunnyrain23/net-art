    <p>
        Are you good at holdin' on? <br>
        I know the mind is quick to throw away the moment <br>
        Where this takes us, maybe I don't wanna know yet <br>
        'Cause for now you're all I want <br>
        They say you got it, then it's gone <br>
        <b>I don't believe that every flame has to get colder <br></b>
        I hope the feelings that you give me carry over <br>
        'Til tomorrow and beyond <br>
        How long <br>
        How long <br>
        <i>Can it just keep getting better? <br> </i>
        Can we keep fallin' forever? <br>
        How long <br>
        How long <br>
        Can we stay, like this, together? <br>
        Can we keep fallin' forever? <br>
        <br>
        <br>
